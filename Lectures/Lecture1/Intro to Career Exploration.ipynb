    "  * Typing out the entire name is quite annoying, if you type `\"cd Fa\"` and press the `Tab` key, it will autocomplete for you!\n",

    "This semester will go over many topics on a relatively high level. We begin with introducing jupyter notebooks (what you are reading from right now!) and use these to teach most of our lectures. Jupyter notebooks are incredibly useful as they allow you to run separate chunks of code at a time, without having to run the entire program at once.\n",

    "6. Linear Regression, Validation, Fitting\n",
    "7. Bias Variance, Regularization\n",
    "8. Kaggle 1 Data Cleaning/Processing\n",
    "9. Kaggle 2 Data Visualization/Linear Models\n",
    "10. Kaggle 3 Decision Trees, Random Forests, Boosting\n",
    "11. Kaggle 4 Neural Networks\n",
    "12. Kaggle 5 Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the semester is packed full of various concepts, from statistical ideas such as bias and variance to machine learning concepts like neural networks and decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The semester is structured so that you will be able to accumulate foundational skills, learn more advanced concepts, and apply them to a final Kaggle competition. \n",
    "\n",
    "The course material is being written by our lovely Education committee! You will get to meet them over the course of the semester as we are rotating lecturers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This schedule is quite ambitious and fast paced as it aims to cover a very large amount of material. Please let us know if you ever have feedback, have questions, or you are just looking for some more help! We are all happy to help out. You can always reach us at slack. "
